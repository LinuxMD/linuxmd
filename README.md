Linux for the Sega MegaDrive

## Is this a joke?

No

## What do I need?

- A Sega Megadrive
- Mega EverDrive Core or Pro (pro is untested) (See: https://krikzz.com/our-products/cartridges/)
- USB cable between the EverDrive and your PC
- Time to burn

## Build instructions

- Run `./buildtoolchain.sh` to build a toolchain. This uses buildroot but we do not build a root
  filesystem with it. buildroot is the least painful way to get a m68k-linux toolchain that can
  produce usable binaries for 68000.

- Run `./builduboot.sh` to use the toolchain to build u-boot.

- Run `./buildmedtool.sh` to build `medtool` to interact with the everdrive for serial console.

- Run `./buildlinux.sh` to build the linux kernel image. (NOTE: at the moment this does not produce a workable image)
